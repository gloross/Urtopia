                We have researched the entire e-bike market and we found that
                73% of e-bike damage problems occur in the shipping process.
                Therefore, we attach great importance to the matter of
                packaging. The cost of the final version of the packaging is the
                most expensive in the industry, but also spent a lot of our
                efforts.

                <br />
                As well as with designers and technicians, it took 2 months to
                design the internal partition structure of the carton, in order
                to make e-bike in the process of transport, to have a better
                fix.

                OTA is known as "Over-The-Air", which is an over-the-air
                download technology. It was widely used in the cell phone
                industry in the early days, ending the complicated operation of
                connecting to a computer, downloading software, and then
                installing updates for cell phone software upgrades.
                <br />
                <br />
                In recent years, with the continuous development of automotive
                Internet connection technology, automotive OTA has also become a
                buzzword in the industry. Remote upgrading of cars through OTA
                technology can not only continuously improve terminal functions
                and services for vehicles, allowing owners to have a more
                convenient and smarter car experience, but can also be used to
                quickly fix vulnerabilities and help implement car recalls. It
                is gradually becoming an important measure for companies to
                solve problems with their software and hardware systems.
                <br />
                <br />
                Tesla launched Modes S using OTA technology . The update range
                involves human-computer interaction, automatic driving, power
                battery system and other modules, when Tesla can complete the
                key card vulnerability, improve the range, increase the maximum
                speed, improve the ride comfort, etc. through OTA, so that the
                car's function iteration is more flexible and convenient.
                <br />
                <br />
                And in the e-bike field, Urtopia is the first technology-based
                e-bike that applies OTA technology.For example, the previous
                Urtopia did not have navigation, but now all Urtopias have
                navigation.
                <br />
                <br />
                It means that you spend money once to buy Urtopia, buy a unique
                e-bike that will be infinitely updated with more features in the
                future, which is worth more than buying any brand and maximizes
                your investment!

                Our Ebikes are less likely to be stolen because we have trigger

                the electricity because they don't have fingerprints, and as

              <div class="faq-content">
                In fact, our 250 W motor is customized motor, and considering
                our e-bike weight is really light, the power of the e-bike will
                be beyond your expectation
                <br /><br />
                Here are some of the reasons why we didn't choose 750 w over 250
                w.
                <br /><br />
                First of all, 750 w motor is heavy, which makes the eBike harder
                to ride when it runs out of power. Our motor is a customized
                motor which fits our purposes of the e-bike best. One of the
                most distinctive features of our eBike is that it is extremely
                light, 250 w is just sufficient for our eBike and it makes it
                easy to ride with or without power assistance.
                <br /><br />
                Smaller motor also requires smaller battery. Our battery is 360
                wh and only weighs 3 kg, you can easily take it out and charge
                it wherever you want.

                Urtopia e-bike is designed for urban commute and leisure riding
                and and not a gravel/mountain bike. Different ebikes in the

                specs that are more suitable for that scenario. urtopia e-bike
                is designed for urban commute and leisure riding and and not a
                gravel/mountain bike.
                <br /><br />
                As you know, the most important feature of our bikes is that
                they are light. A mid-mounted motor is heavy and the frame can
                be very bulky at the bottom bracket.
                <br /><br />
                On the other hand, the rear motor is not only lightweight, but
                also maintains aesthetics and performance.The rear motor also
                has better maneuverability than the front motor, giving you a
                silky smooth ride.
                <br /><br />
                That's why many customers decide to place an order without even
                touching our bikes offline, and are surprised by the smooth
                riding experience after receiving the bike!
                <br /><br />
                Our team developed unique algorithms that make our rear hub
                motor's riding experience comparable to that of a mid-mounted
                motor. This is the reason why many people still like Urtopia
                very much after they ride it.
                <br /><br />
                Urtopia is a technology-based company . We do not do ordinary
                e-bike, whether it is the design, or the manufacture of
                accessories. As you can see, we spend money on design, doing
                innovation, not choosing the public mill inside the factory, but
                independent development, independent creation, independent
                design, even though this thought has higher costs and risks,
                this is the difference between Urtopia and other e-bike.

                safety of customers, so we think it is very necessary even if it
                is more expensive.

                <strong>Simple maintenance:</strong> The most troublesome part
                of a variable-speed bike is the entire complex drivetrain, from
                the rear derailleur to the flywheel, which is a pain to clean.
                And there are very few cases of dropped chains, and the entire
                drivetrain will not be crippled by a mistake in one part of the
                shifting system. <br /><br />
                <strong>Lighter:</strong> With less shifting system, the bike
                will be much lighter, which is the biggest feature of the
                Urtopia. <br /><br />
                <strong>Simpler riding:</strong> The simple construction allows
                you to think less, you just have to focus on pedaling, and you
                don't have to worry about shifting or anything else at all.
                <br /><br />
                <strong>Minimalist style:</strong> Single speed bikes can be
                designed in a minimalist style, and this style of bike looks
                very clean and crisp. The simpler shape is also our Urtopia
                design philosophy. <br /><br />
                <strong>On the other hand,</strong> the performance of the
                single speed is much higher than the shifting, which can give
                you a more silky smooth riding experience, which is also praised
                by very many customers. Shifting really makes it more
                complicated . We have smart bars to handle all the problems
                without shifting. <br /><br />
                We have 4 different speeds that are controlled through the
                Smartbar, so we don't need gears in terms of speed changes. Our
                e-bikes are very light so you don't have to make as much effort
                to get the bike to climb, and with power assist it's even
                easier. Unlike other e-bike clutches, Urtopia's built-in clutch
                adds mechanical damping when the power is off, allowing you to
                ride our e-bike like a traditional bike without adding extra
                effort. That means it's not difficult to ride when the battery
                runs out.
                <br /><br />
                Single speed without gears is a perfect fitness bike . If you
                need to exercise , this is the most suitable for your e-bike！

                Urtopia is made of full carbon fibre, including the frame,
                handlebar, forks, and seatpost. This material absorbs vibrations
                effectively.
                <br /><br />
                In addition, Urtopia e-bike is designed for urban commute and
                not a gravel/mountain bike. So we think it meets the needs for
                suspension for most urban scenarios.

                The biggest difference in Urtopia is that it's a smart e-bike,
